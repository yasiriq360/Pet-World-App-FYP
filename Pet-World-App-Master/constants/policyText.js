1. Privacy Policy
Pet World App (“the App”) is committed to protecting your personal information in accordance with Pakistani law. Pakistan’s constitution recognizes the right to privacy (Article 14), and a draft Personal Data Protection Bill (DPDP 2023) is pending enactment. Under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016, personal and digital data must be secured against misuse. We collect and process user data only with consent and for legitimate App purposes.


1. For Pet Owners (General Users)
Pet World App collects:
• Basic Profile Data: name, contact details (email/phone), age/ID if required, and account credentials.
• Pet Information: pet names, types, ages, medical history, and photos (for the pet profile feature).
• Payment Information: billing details when you purchase a plan (handled securely via approved payment gateways).
• Usage Data: information on your App usage (device ID, login times, preferences) to improve service quality.

We use this information to operate your account, provide vet services, send notifications, and improve the App. We do not sell or share your personal data with unaffiliated third parties without your explicit consent, except to comply with legal obligations (such as responding to lawful requests or preventing fraud under PECA). We retain data only as long as needed for these purposes and protect it with industry-standard security measures.

You have rights over your data: you may access, correct, or delete your personal information. If the DPDP Act becomes law, it will entitle you to rights like consent withdrawal and data portability. By using the App, you consent to this Privacy Policy and our collection and use of data as described.
2. For Service Providers (Veterinary Professionals)
Vets and service providers must also protect their account information. We collect your professional credentials (name, qualifications, PVMC registration number, clinic address, contact info) and identity documents to verify your license (see Vet Verification Policy). We use this data to operate your vet profile, enable appointments, and comply with legal requirements. As with pet owners, we will not share your personal data externally without consent or legal requirement.

All users (owners and vets) agree to provide accurate, up-to-date information. You may update or delete your profile data in account settings. If the DPDP or related laws come into force, we will ensure you can exercise the full rights provided (e.g., right to review or remove your data).
2. Terms & Conditions
Pet World App’s services are governed by Pakistani law, including the Electronic Transactions Ordinance 2002 and PECA 2016. Electronic agreements (like these Terms) are legally binding under Pakistani law. By registering, you agree to follow our rules and local laws.
1. For Pet Owners (General Users)
• Service Use: You must be a legal adult (18+). You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes. Your account information must be true and complete.
• Subscriptions & Payments: All prices and plans (see Subscription Policy) are in PKR and fully disclosed in the App. You authorize recurring billing for subscription fees until you cancel via the App Store or our interface. There are no refunds under any circumstances (see Refund Policy).
• Content and Conduct: You may post pet profiles and inquiries to veterinarians but must not upload or transmit illegal or offensive content (see Community Guidelines). Do not attempt to access other users’ data or the App’s back-end systems; unauthorized access or hacking is prohibited by PECA.
• Legal Obligations: You agree that all electronic communications (chats, requests) via the App are governed by PECA, which prohibits fraud, harassment, hate speech, defamation, and false information. Information that could incite panic or unrest is strictly forbidden. If you violate these Terms or the law, we may suspend or terminate your account without warning.
2. For Service Providers (Veterinary Professionals)
• Professional Qualifications: You must provide a valid veterinary license and PVMC registration. It is illegal in Pakistan to practice or charge fees as a vet without PVMC registration. The App verifies your credentials before you are listed. You must keep your qualifications current; presenting unrecognized credentials is prohibited.
• Content and Conduct: When communicating with pet owners, maintain professionalism. Do not spam users or misuse the App’s messaging (spam and unsolicited communications are regulated under PTA rules). Follow our Community Guidelines and applicable medical standards.
• Liability: You are responsible for your advice and actions. The App is not liable for your professional services owners must verify your qualifications. All disputes between vets and pet owners should be resolved amicably or by legal means, acknowledging local professional regulations.


3. Refund & Cancellation Policy
• No Refunds: All sales are final. Once you purchase a subscription plan or one-time pet profile fee, the transaction cannot be refunded for any reason. This policy is clearly disclosed before purchase to comply with legal standards of transparency.
• Service Providers: Vets do not pay subscription fees, so this Policy does not apply to them.
4. Cookie Policy
Pet World App may use cookies or similar local storage to maintain sessions or remember preferences. Pakistani law does not specifically regulate cookies yet, but general data protection principles apply. We use minimal cookies solely for essential functions (authentication, settings) and do not use them for advertising. You will be informed if any new tracking methods are introduced, and you will have the option to opt out. We follow the draft DPDP principles (transparency, purpose limitation) in our cookie usage.
5. Subscription & Pricing Policy
Our App offers the following plans (all prices in PKR):
• One-Time Pet Profile (Basic): PKR 300 for one pet profile (lifetime access to that profile).
• Multi Pet Profiles (Standard): PKR 500 for up to 3 pet profiles. 
• Lifetime Pet Profiles (Premium): PKR 2,000 one-time for up to 100 pet profiles (no expiration).

All fees are clearly listed in-app. There are no hidden charges. Pricing for any new features or future plans will be communicated in advance. We comply with consumer protection requirements for transparency in pricing. After purchase, you agree that no refunds will be issued (see Refund Policy).
1. For Service Providers (Vets)
Service providers do not pay for these plans, so the Subscription Policy applies only to pet owners. Vets may use the App for free, subject to verification.
6. Data Protection & User Consent Policy
Pet World App adheres to strong data protection standards even before formal laws take effect. We comply with PECA’s requirement to secure user data and with emerging DPDP guidelines. We implement security measures (encryption, access controls) to prevent unauthorized access or breaches. Our servers and services undergo regular security audits; user data is retained only as long as necessary.


1. Consent and Rights – Pet Owners
By creating an account and using the App, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy. Consent is given freely at registration (via an “I Agree” checkbox). You may withdraw consent at any time by deleting your account, at which point we will erase your personal data from our active systems (except what we must keep for legal reasons). If the DPDP or similar laws come into force, you will have formal rights to access, correct, or delete your data.
2. Consent and Rights – Service Providers
Service providers similarly consent to use their professional data when signing up. You agree to keep us informed of any changes (e.g. license renewals). You may request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal retention requirements), and we will comply except where data must be kept for regulatory or legal purposes (for example, to report a serious malpractice as required by law).
7. Content Moderation Policy
Pet World App hosts user-generated content (pet profiles, chat messages, reviews). We enforce a strict moderation policy to comply with Pakistani law and community standards. All content must be lawful and non-offensive.


• Prohibited Content: Illegal activities (e.g. selling banned substances), hate speech, threats, harassment, defamation, pornography, graphic violence, gambling, and content promoting terrorism or sedition are forbidden. PECA criminalizes spreading false news or extremist content such content will be removed immediately.
• Vet-Related Content: Medical advice posts or questions must not encourage unsafe practices. Pet owners should not post misinformation about treatments. Vets must give advice responsibly; falsely diagnosing or promising cures for illegal treatments is prohibited.
• User Reports: Users can report violating content through in-app controls. Reported content is reviewed by our moderators. If a post violates policy, we remove it or ask the user to revise it. Repeat offenders may have their accounts suspended or banned.
• Legal Compliance: We cooperate with Pakistani authorities on valid takedown requests. If content involves a credible crime or threat, we will preserve evidence and report to law enforcement. We also comply with PTA rules on spam: unsolicited commercial messages are blocked and marked if needed.
1. For Pet Owners
When communicating in the App, treat others with respect. Do not post fraudulent or misleading information (for example, claiming false credentials). If you see prohibited content, report it. Remember you are legally responsible for what you share.
2. For Service Providers (Vets)
Ensure your profile and any public advice are honest and legal. Do not post unverified remedies or administer medical advice that violates veterinary regulations. All professional content must abide by local veterinary standards and by PECA’s restrictions on false information. Vets who repeatedly post prohibited content may have their service access revoked and will be reported to the PVMC if laws are broken.
8. Vet Verification & Qualification Policy
Pet World App ensures all listed veterinarians are properly qualified under Pakistani law. Only licensed vets may register as service providers. Under the Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council Act 1996, a person must be registered with the PVMC to legally practice and to recover fees for veterinary services. It is a criminal offense to hold oneself out as a vet without recognized qualifications.  
1. For Pet Owners
All veterinarians displayed on the App have been vetted by us. We verify each vet’s PVMC registration number and degree credentials. You may trust that our vets are legally allowed to treat animals in Pakistan. If you suspect a vet is unqualified or misrepresenting credentials, please report them to us and to PVMC.


2. For Service Providers (Vets)
To join Pet World App as a service provider, you must submit:
• A scanned copy of your PVMC registration certificate.
• Proof of veterinary qualification (degree certificate).
• Valid identification and contact information.
We verify these documents with the PVMC’s register. Only after successful verification will your profile be approved. You must notify us immediately if your license is suspended or revoked. Misleading us or other users by using an unrecognized title or an expired license violates this policy and Pakistani law; offenders will be removed and may be reported.
9. Community Guidelines / User Behavior Policy
Our community’s success depends on respectful interaction. All users must follow these guidelines in addition to formal policies.
1. For Pet Owners
• Respect: Communicate courteously with vets and other users. Do not insult, harass, or bully anyone.
• Privacy: Do not attempt to access others’ private profiles or data. Do not share personal contact information of vets or owners without permission.
• Truthfulness: Provide accurate information about your pets. Do not post deceptive or irrelevant content (spam). Misleading reviews or fake testimonials are not allowed.
2. For Service Providers (Vets)
• Professionalism: Present yourself and your services honestly. Use polite, clear language with clients. Maintain confidentiality and privacy of owner–pet discussions as required by law.
• No Unsolicited Contact: Only communicate with pet owners in response to App requests. Do not use the App to promote unrelated services or send marketing messages; unsolicited communications are regulated	.
• Compliance: Do not encourage owners to break laws (e.g. wildlife smuggling, banned substances).
Always follow ethical guidelines of the veterinary profession and local regulations.

Violation of these guidelines may result in warnings, content removal, or account suspension. Repeated or severe breaches will lead to permanent bans.
10. Customer Support & Dispute Resolution Policy
We strive to resolve issues quickly and fairly.


1. Pet Owners
If you have any questions, complaints, or account issues, you may contact our customer support via the in- app “Help” section or email. We typically respond within 2 business days. Please provide your account details and a clear description of the issue. We will investigate and work to resolve your problem.

If you dispute a veterinarian’s services (for example, you believe malpractice occurred), you should first try to resolve it amicably with the vet. If that fails, you may escalate the issue by emailing support. We will review any evidence (chat logs, receipts) and attempt mediation. For unresolved disputes, Pakistani law provides consumer courts and grievance mechanisms at the provincial level. You may seek recourse through those formal channels if necessary.


2. Service Providers (Vets)
Vets with account or platform issues (profile edits, technical issues) should contact support similarly. If a vet has a complaint about a pet owner (e.g. abuse, harassment), report it to us. We will take appropriate action on the owner’s account as needed.

Governing Law & Jurisdiction

These policies and any disputes are governed by the laws of Pakistan. By using Pet World App, both users and vets agree to resolve disputes under Pakistani jurisdiction.
11. Acceptable Use Policy

• Security: Do not attempt to hack, reverse-engineer, or otherwise tamper with the App. Do not distribute malware or viruses.

You agree not to disrupt or interfere with the App’s operation.
1. For Service Providers (Vets)
